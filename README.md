# Test DApp with MetaMask in Red kovan 

# Brownie React Mix

This mix comes with everything you need to start using [React](https://reactjs.org/) with a Brownie project.

## Installation

1. [Install Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html), if you haven't already. You must be using version `1.9.0` or newer.

2. Download the mix.

    ```bash
    brownie bake react-mix
    ```

3. Install the React client dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ./client
    yarn install
    ```
    or 

    ```bash
    cd ./client
    npm install 
    ```

4. If you want to be able to deploy to testnets, do the following.

    Set your WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID, and PRIVATE_KEY environment variables.

    You can get a WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID by getting a free trial of Infura. At the moment, it does need to be infura with brownie. If you get lost, follow the instructions at https://ethereumico.io/knowledge-base/infura-api-key-guide/. You can find your PRIVATE_KEY from your ethereum wallet like metamask.

    You'll also need testnet ETH. You can get ETH into your wallet by using the faucet for the appropriate
    testnet. For Kovan, a faucet is available at https://linkfaucet.protofire.io/kovan.

    You can add your environment variables to a .env file. You can use the .env_example in this repo 
    as a template, just fill in the values and rename it to '.env'. 

    Here is what your .env should look like:

    ```bash
    export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
    export PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
    ```
   
5. Create brownie account(s) following instructions here:
       https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/account-management.html

6. Import the brownie account to MetaMask using their private key(s)



## Usage

1. Open the Brownie console. Starting the console launches a fresh [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) instance in the background.

    ```bash
    $ brownie console
    Brownie v1.9.0 - Python development framework for Ethereum

    ReactMixProject is the active project.
    Launching 'ganache-cli'...
    Brownie environment is ready.
    ```

    Alternatively, to run on Kovan, set the network flag to kovan

    ```bash
    $ brownie console --network kovan
    Brownie v1.14.6 - Python development framework for Ethereum

    ReactMixProject is the active project.
    Brownie environment is ready.
    ```

2. Run the [deployment script](scripts/deploy.py) to deploy the project's smart contracts.

    ```python
    >>> run("deploy")
    Running 'scripts.deploy.main'...
    Transaction sent: 0xd1000d04fe99a07db864bcd1095ddf5cb279b43be8e159f94dbff9d4e4809c70
    Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 6721975
    SolidityStorage.constructor confirmed - Block: 1   Gas used: 110641 (1.65%)
    SolidityStorage deployed at: 0xF104A50668c3b1026E8f9B0d9D404faF8E42e642

    Transaction sent: 0xee112392522ed24ac6ab8cc8ba09bfe51c5d699d9d1b39294ba87e5d2a56212c
    Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 6721975
    VyperStorage.constructor confirmed - Block: 2   Gas used: 134750 (2.00%)
    VyperStorage deployed at: 0xB8485421abC325D172652123dBd71D58b8117070
    ```

3. While Brownie is still running, start the React app in a different terminal.

    The first time this app is used, the node modules have to be installed in /src.
    To do this, navigate to ./client/src and run

    ```bash
    # make sure to use a different terminal, not the brownie console
    npm install
    npm audit fix
    ```

4. Connect Metamask to the local Ganache network. In the upper right corner, click the network dropdown menu. Select `Localhost 8545`, or `Kovan test network`:



5. Interact with the smart contracts using the web interface or via the Brownie console.

    ```python
    # get the newest vyper storage contract
    >>> vyper_storage = VyperStorage[-1]

    # the default sender of the transaction is the contract creator
    >>> vyper_storage.set(1337)
    ```

    Any changes to the contracts from the console should show on the website after a refresh, and vice versa.

## Ending a Session

When you close the Brownie console, the Ganache instance also terminates and the deployment artifacts are deleted.

To retain your deployment artifacts (and their functionality) you can launch Ganache yourself prior to launching Brownie. Brownie automatically attaches to the ganache instance where you can deploy the contracts. After closing Brownie, the chain and deployment artifacts will persist.

## Further Possibilities

### Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
brownie test
```

### Deploying to a Live Network

To deploy your contracts to the mainnet or one of the test nets, first modify [`scripts/deploy.py`](`scripts/deploy.py`) to [use a funded account](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/account-management.html).

Then:

```bash
brownie run deploy --network kovan
```

Replace `kovan` with the name of the network you wish you use. You may also wish to adjust Brownie's [network settings](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/network-management.html).

For contracts deployed on a live network, the deployment information is stored permanently unless you:

* Delete or rename the contract file or
* Manually remove the `client/src/artifacts/` directory


## Resources

This mix provides a bare-bones implementation of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), configured to work with Brownie.

To get started with React and building a front-end for your dApps:

* [Rimble](https://rimble.consensys.design/) is an open-source library of React components and guides to help you make dApps. Along with components they provide guides and tutorials to help you get started.
* For more in-depth information, read the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)


To get started with Brownie:

* Check out the other [Brownie mixes](https://github.com/brownie-mix/) that can be used as a starting point for your own contracts. They also provide example code to help you get started.
* ["Getting Started with Brownie"](https://medium.com/@iamdefinitelyahuman/getting-started-with-brownie-part-1-9b2181f4cb99) is a good tutorial to help you familiarize yourself with Brownie

# Deploy Dapp 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
